# idea

personal podcast (either for oneself or to share thoughts with someone else)

# implementation

webaudio + s3 + cloudflare worker

page has a prompt, a headline of an article that gets linked (must be sanitized)

Podcast feed:

```
Item:
  Title: <name>'s thoughts on <article>

  Description:
    Thoughts on [<article>]

    [Report inappropriate content]

  Image: generated
  Explicit: true
  pubDate: <date>

```




## client details

javascript webaudio (needs iOS safari support)

### recorder details

create AudioContext

create scriptProcessorNode (for iOS support)

wire up so that it reads into an AudioBuffer

when buffer full, spill into a Float32Array

to edit, encode to Wav

to snip, update Float32Array and reencode to Wav, reload edit

to upload, reencode to mp3

### UI details

URL to create a prompt page (to remind one of the topic), button to record

on click record button, webaudio buffer filled

maybe have button for section break?

once done, in page editing (cut out sections, move sections)
  this happens on the raw sample buffer

on finish, apply basic filters, add generated music, add ad inserts, convert to mp3 and upload to s3 under creds

for two person podcast, transfer p2 to p1, sequence align sample buffers and take average between both (where? in browser or in cloudflare worker?)

 - BLAST-style sequence alignment on every sample is too computationally/memory intensive
 - use lamport timestamps to periodically bound the approx time of samples, and use that to create a global alignment
 - every 15 seconds:
  - t1 <- current-sample-number, p1.send(p2, 'sync')
  - p2.recv(p1), p2.send(p1, 'sync-ack', current-sample-number)
  - t3 <- p1.recv(p1)
   t1 < t2 < t3
 - sequence align sample segment between t1 and t3
 - use spring model to globally align
 
TODO: whose creds
TODO: where to do sequence alignment?
